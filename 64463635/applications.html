  <h1>Potential applications of Quantum Computing</h1>
  <p>


  <p>
  <div class="center-text">
    Applications of quantum computing means that uncertainty will result in “private keys for encrypting” (Ghose).
    Hackers would have to “break” the “laws of quantum physics” (Ghose). It would transform healthcare and medicine:
    currently molecule modeling is a challenge due to the quantum properties of subatomic particles. Quantum computing
    may be used to treat diseases like Alzheimers. It may result in the “teleportation of information without physical
    transportation” and can be used to “probe the mysteries of nature” (Ghose).

  <div class="center-text">
    <ol>
      <li>Cryptography: Most cryptography is determined by difficulty for classical computers to factor integers or by
        the discrete logarithm problem, but Shor’s algorithm can decipher both. Secure web pages, encrypted email,
        and other kinds of data are protected by the RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman algorithms.
        Breaking these will lead to insecure electronic privacy and security.</li><br><br>
      <li>Search problems: Finding an item out of a list of items in a database can be solved using Grover’s algorithm.</li><br><br>
      <li>Simulation of quantum systems: Nanotechnology and chemistry are dependent upon the understanding of quantum systems,
        which cannot be simulated effectively on a classical computer. Being able to simulate the movement of atoms and
        particles will allow scientists to replicate reactions inside the collider or find a more efficient way of growing
        crops than the Haber process.</li><br><br>
      <li>Quantum annealing and adiabatic optimization: QA is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_annealing" target="_blank">“metaheuristic for finding the global minimum of a given objective function over a given set of
          candidate solutions, by a process using quantum fluctuations”</a></li><br><br>
      <li>Machine Learning: Quantum algorithms may be able to speed up machine learning asks. For example, “the
        quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, or “HHL Algorithm”, named after its discoverers Harrow,
        Hassidim, and Lloyd, is believed to provide speedup over classical counterparts”</li><br><br>
      <li>Computational biology: computing can solve many biological problems, such as gene sequencing.</li><br><br>
      <li>Quantum supremacy: The term, introduced by John Preskill, refers to the point at which the quantum computer
        would over take a classical computer in terms of how long it takes to solve a problem. In 2019 a
        Sycamore processor created by Google calculated a problem 3,000,000 times as fast as Summit, the world’s
        fastest supercomputer, could.</li><br><br>
