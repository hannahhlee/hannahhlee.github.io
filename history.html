    “Alan Key, a distinguished computer scientist, once characterized the difference between natural sciences and
    computer science in the following way. In natural sciences, Nature has given us the world, and we just discovered
    its laws. In computers, we can stuff the laws into it and create the world. Experiments in quantum physics are
    now creating artificial physical systems that obey the laws of quantum mechanics but do not exist in nature under
    normal conditions” (Ambainis). <br><br>
    <em>Shohini Ghose: A beginner’s guide to quantum computing</em> describes a game of heads or tails in which a person would have a
    50% chance of winning a game. However, if you could play this game on a quantum computer, as IBM has built, a
    quantum computer has a 97% chance of winning the game. The 3% error is due to errors. She goes on to explain
    that a light bulb is not a candle; a quantum computer is not a classical computer. Quantum computing has the
    power to affect healthcare, security needs, and the internet. She describes a quantum bit as being “fluid” or
    having a “nonbinary identity”: there is some probability of being 1 or 0 (Ghose). The probability exists on a
    spectrum: there is a 70% chance of being 0 and 30% chance of being one, for example. This is due to superposition
    and uncertainty. <br><br>
    <br><br>
    Quantum computing using the phenomena of quantum mechanics such as superposition (where <a href="https://iotpractitioner.com/quantum-computing-series-part-4-superposition-in-quantum-mechanics/)"
    target="_blank">“a quantum system can exist in multiple states or places at the exact same time”</a> and entanglement. With superposition, binary constraints are no longer a factor. Instead of bits,
    particles represent qubits, which can be 0, 1, or both at the same time.<br><br>
    While digital computers are developed via transistors, with data being encoded into binary digits or bits, at either 0 or 1, a quantum computer uses quantum bits, which can be in a state of
    superposition. N Qubits can be in a superposition of 2^n states.  <br><br></div>

     <div class ="center-text"><ul></ul>
    <li>1968: Stephen Wisner invents conjugate coding, which is a cryptographic instrument. The application was founded
      on quantum multiplexing, which is a way of transmitting more than one message wherein one is read and the others
      are destroyed (“Conjugate Coding”).</li><br>
    <li>1970: James Park says that it is it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem)"
    target="_blank">“impossible to create an independent and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state,”</a>
    a statement known as the no-cloning theorem </li><br>
    <li>1973: Alexander Holevo creates Holevo’s theorem or Holevo’s bound in a paper illustrating that n qubits are
      capable of carrying more than n classical bits of information, but that the maximum accessible number of bits is
      n classical bits. </li><br>
    <li>Charles H. Bennett demonstrates that computation can be in done in the reverse</li><br>
    <li>1975: R.P. Poplavskii publishes “Thermodynamical models of information processing”. Thepaper illustrates that
       because of the superposition principle, one cannot simulate quantum systems on classical computers. </li><br>
    <li>1976: Polish mathematical physicist Roman Stanislaw Ingarden publishes a paper called “Quantum Information Theory”
      in Reports on Mathematical Physics, vol. 10, 43-72, 1976. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory"
      target="_blank">Information theory is the study of counting, storing, and communicating digital information.</a>
      In  it he says that one cannot simply attribute the digital information theory to quantum but create a generalized
      version of the existing digital information theory “within the formalism of a generalized quantum mechanics of
      open systems and a generalized concept of observables”.</li><br>
    <li>1980: Paul Benioff describes the first quantum computer in a paper.<br>
    <li>Yuri Manin “motivates the idea of quantum computing”</li><br>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toffoli_gate"
    target="_blank">Tommaso Toffoli creates a universal reversible logic gate.</a> A logic gate is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate"
    target="_blank">“idealized model of computation or physical electronic device implementing a Boolean function,
    a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output.” </a></li></ul><br>
    <li>At the First Conference on the Physics of Computation at MIT, Paul Benioff and Richard Feynman give talks on quantum computing.
      Benioff showed that a computer can work under the laws of quantum mechanics. Feynman’s talk illustrated that it was
      impossible to effectively simulate the development of a quantum system on a classical computer. He also proposed a
      quantum computer model.</li><br>
    <li>1982: Paul develops his initial model of a “quantum mechanical Turing machine”</li><br>
    <li>1984: Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard implement Wisner’s “conjugate coding for distribution of cryptographic keys”.</li><br>
    <li>1985: David Deutsch demonstrates math of a of a <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~csxam/teaching/history.pdf"
    target="_blank">“quantum Turing machine to model quantum computation”.</a></li><br>
    <li>1994: Peter Shor, at AT&T’s Bell Labs in New Jersey, finds an algorithm that allows quantum computers to factor
      large integers at great speed. In theory, his algorithm is capable of breaking may cryptosystems that are implemented
      today.</li><br>
    <li>1995: Peter Shor proposes first plans for “quantum error correction”</li><br>
    <li>1996: Lov Grover, at Bell Labs, creates the quantum database search algorithm. It is a quadratic speedup that can
      be applied to a wide array of problems.</li><br>

    <li>First time Grover’s algorithm is executed on an NMR computer</li><br>
    <li>Hidetoshi Nishimori et al illustrated quantum annealing algorithm can outperform classical counterpart</li><br>
    <li>2000: Arun K Pati and Samuel L Braunstein prove quantum no-deleting theorem, which illustrates that it is
    impossible to delete a copy of an unknown qubit. With the no-cloning theorem, it shows that “quantum information
    can neither be created nor be destroyed”.</li><br>
    <li>Order finding executed for first time (subset of Shor’s Algorithm)</li><br>
